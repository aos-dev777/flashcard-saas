## 👨‍💻 About the Developer

**Omer Tariq**  
AI-Driven Product Builder | CS @ UT Dallas | Founder @ AOS Projects

This project was developed by **Omer Tariq** as part of a hands-on initiative with **Headstarter AI**, where I led the end-to-end build of an AI-powered SaaS flashcard platform. Drawing from my experience as a student and developer, I combined OpenAI’s GPT-4o API with Firebase, Clerk, and Stripe to streamline the way students prepare for exams.

I designed and shipped this tool to demonstrate how LLMs can generate personalized study experiences at scale — built fully in **Next.js** with responsive UI, secure authentication, and dynamic user flows.
